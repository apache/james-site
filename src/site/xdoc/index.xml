      <p>The James Project offers a diverse set of open source Java solutions related to internet email and is a part of The Apache Software Foundation (ASF) which encourages a collaborative, consensus-based development process under an open software license.</p>
      <p>James is organized into subprojects, having James Server as the main of them. The ASF contains other Java projects, some of which were a part of Jakarta, that are detailed on the ASF Project page.</p>
      <p>It is recommended that users of James products subscribe to the James announcements mailing list.</p>

     <h4>James PMC react to the closure of Apache Avalon.</h4>
      <p>James PMC would like to reassure all of our users that James is alive and well. All of the James team have kept abreast of the Avalon developments culminating in the closure of the Avalon project and dispersal of its codebase. We are are keen to stress that this has little impact on our ability to support and develop James in both the short and long terms.<br/>Over the coming months we will be finalising and publishing a road map for James which will address all of the specific concerns raised by Avalon's closure, but rest assured James' future is safe, and we have enthusiasm and plans aplenty.<br/> In the meantime we would like to extend our best wishes to all our friends from Avalon, here's luck with your future projects guys!<br/> If you are at all concerned please subscribe to the server-user mailing list and raise your points there. - 05/Jan/2005</p>

      <h4>James source has moved to "Subversion"</h4>
      <p>Subversion is a version control system like CVS, but it has advantages over CVS for Apache Software Foundation (ASF) projects.<br/> In common with all other ASF projects we have reviewed our use of CVS and migrated our code to Subversion.<br/>
Have a look at this <a href="FAQ.html#17">FAQ</a> for further details. - 05/Jan/2005</p>
